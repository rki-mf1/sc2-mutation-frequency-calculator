# SC2 Mutation Frequency Calculator 
A covSonar Utility tool to detect character and signature mutations based on mutation frequencies. 

## Setup 

### Prerequisites
Ultimately, the same conda environment as for covsonar can be used. Otherwise there are some packages neccessary for using the tool.
(conda export environment packages)

### Input
Dataset (national, international) 
Timeframe 

### Default
Mutation frequency matrix 
(plot)

## Examples

### variant-specific pcr test-design

### consensus^2 for representing a lineage

## Best practice

### Inputformat
### Presence of overlap in the data 

## Q&A

### characteristic vs signature mutations? 

## Limitations 
Pre- vs postpandemic data
